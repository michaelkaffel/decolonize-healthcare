# Build Log — decolonize-healthcare

## Phase 1 — Foundation ✅

### Scaffold
- Vite + React 18 client (`npm create vite@latest client -- --template react`)
- Extra client deps: `react-redux`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`, `react-router-dom`, `tailwindcss@^3.4.14`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`, `eslint`, `@eslint/js`, `eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `globals`
- Tailwind v3 pinned explicitly — Vite pulls v4 by default which is a breaking change
- Express server scaffolded manually in `server/`
- Extra server deps: `express`, `cors`, `dotenv`, `mongoose`, `express-session`, `connect-mongo`, `passport`, `passport-google-oauth20`, `passport-local-mongoose`, `stripe`, `@google-cloud/storage`, `globals` (devDep)
- `passport-local` not listed explicitly — included as a dep of `passport-local-mongoose`
- CI workflow: GitHub Actions, two steps — lint + build client, lint server
- Server ESLint config uses `globals.node` for Node built-ins (`process`, `console`)
- `.vscode/settings.json` added to client with `"css.validate": false` to suppress `@tailwind` directive warnings
- MongoDB Atlas cluster created under Owl's Gmail account (`decolonize-healthcare` cluster, Google Cloud, `us-central1`)
- Repo: github.com/michaelkaffel/decolonize-healthcare (public, pinned to portfolio)

### MongoDB Connection (`server/db.js`)
- Cached promise pattern — prevents duplicate connections on repeated calls
- `connectionPromise` reset to `null` on failure to allow retries
- `start()` async function in `index.js` awaits `connectDB()` before starting the server

### User Model (`server/models/User.js`)
- Fields: `name`, `email` (required, unique), `googleId`, `createdAt`
- `username`, `hash`, `salt` injected automatically by `passport-local-mongoose` plugin
- `hash` is `select: false` by default — must `.select('+hash')` in routes that need it

### Passport Config (`server/config/passport.js`)
- `serializeUser` / `deserializeUser` using MongoDB `_id`
- Google OAuth strategy wrapped in `configurePassport()` export — called after `dotenv/config` loads to ensure env vars are available
- Google OAuth callback handles three cases:
  - Existing user with `googleId` → log in
  - Existing user without `googleId` → link accounts, log in
  - New user → create with `googleId` + `username: email`, log in

### Session Middleware (`server/index.js`)
- `express-session` with `connect-mongo` session store
- `cookie.secure` set to `true` in production only
- Session `maxAge` 7 days
- `passport.initialize()` + `passport.session()` wired after session middleware

### Auth Routes (`server/routes/auth.js`)
- `POST /api/auth/register` — creates user with `passport-local-mongoose` `.register()`, logs in on success. Anti-enumeration: identical response whether email exists or not.
- `POST /api/auth/login` — checks for Google-only account via `.select('+hash')` before attempting local auth. Uses `passport.authenticate('local')` as callback (not middleware) to allow custom response handling.
- `POST /api/auth/logout` — calls `req.logout()` with callback (Passport v0.6+ requirement)
- `GET /api/auth/me` — session check, returns user data if authenticated
- `GET /api/auth/google` — initiates Google OAuth flow
- `GET /api/auth/google/callback` — handles OAuth callback, redirects to `/dashboard` on success or `/login?error=oauth` on failure

### isAuthenticated Middleware (`server/middleware/isAuthenticated.js`)
- Calls `req.isAuthenticated()` — returns `401` if false, calls `next()` if true
- Imported directly in route files that need it, not in `index.js`

## Phase 2 — Course Data ✅

### Data Models

**Course Model (`server/models/Course.js`)**
- Nested subdocument structure: Course → modules → lessons → quiz questions
- `correctIndex` on quiz questions has `select: false` — answers never leave the server
- `gcsPath` on PDF subdocuments has `select: false` — raw GCS paths never exposed to client
- `_id: true` on all subdocuments — each module, lesson, and question gets its own ObjectId for progress tracking and quiz submission
- `timestamps: true` on top-level schema for `createdAt`/`updatedAt`
- `slug` field with unique index
- `price` stored in cents (Stripe convention)
- `videoSource` enum: `'youtube'`, `'bunny'`, or `null`

**Enrollment Model (`server/models/Enrollment.js`)**
- Refs to User and Course
- `stripeSessionId` required — enrollment only created via Stripe webhook
- `status` enum: `'active'` or `'refunded'`
- Compound unique index on `{ user, course }` prevents duplicate enrollments (idempotent against duplicate webhook deliveries)

**LessonProgress Model (`server/models/LessonProgress.js`)**
- Refs to User, Course; plain ObjectId for lesson (subdocument reference)
- `quizPassed` boolean for lessons with quizzes
- Compound unique index on `{ user, course, lesson }`

**QuizAttempt Model (`server/models/QuizAttempt.js`)**
- Tracks individual quiz attempts with score and pass/fail
- Non-unique index on `{ user, lesson }` — multiple attempts allowed
- `attemptedAt` timestamp

### Seed Script (`server/scripts/seedCourse.js`)
- Run with `cd server && npm run seed`
- Wipes all courses (`deleteMany`) then inserts one dev course — idempotent
- Dev course: "Decolonizing Your Health Practice", 2 modules, 3 lessons total
- Includes quiz questions with `correctIndex`, PDF references with `gcsPath`, YouTube video placeholders
- Price set to 9900 (cents) to match Stripe convention

### Public Course Routes (`server/routes/courses.js`)
- `GET /api/courses` — returns published courses with summary fields only (`title`, `slug`, `description`, `price`, `thumbnail`)
- `GET /api/courses/:slug` — returns course with module/lesson outlines (titles and order) but no content, video IDs, quiz answers, or GCS paths
- Wired in `index.js` as `app.use('/api/courses', courseRoutes)`

### Database
- MongoDB Atlas database named `decolonize-healthcare` (explicitly set in `MONGODB_URI` path segment)
- Database name must be specified in connection string — defaults to `test` if omitted

## Key Decisions & Notes

- **Sessions over JWT** — DCH runs on Cloud Run (persistent Express server), not Cloud Functions. Sessions + cookies work naturally in a browser context. JWT would be needed for a native mobile client, which is not in scope.
- **Cloud Run vs Cloud Functions** — persistent server means standard Passport flow works without the stream consumption workarounds required in WWT.
- **Google OAuth credentials** — placeholder values in `.env` during development. Real credentials needed before OAuth flow can be tested.
- **Account linking** — local + Google OAuth accounts are linked by matching email. Google-only accounts detected by absence of `hash` field.
- **Anti-enumeration** — auth endpoints return identical generic responses regardless of whether email exists in DB.
- **Price in cents** — all prices stored as integers in cents to match Stripe's API convention and avoid floating point issues.
- **Subdocument `select: false`** — Mongoose `select: false` on nested subdocument fields (`correctIndex`, `gcsPath`) ensures sensitive data is excluded from queries by default. Must explicitly `.select('+field')` when server-side access is needed.

## Phase 3 — Payments ✅

### Stripe Setup
- Using Michael's Stripe account in sandbox/test mode for development
- Owl will create her own Stripe account for production — swap keys at deploy time
- Test mode keys in `server/.env`: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (`sk_test_...`) and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (`whsec_...`)
- Local webhook testing via Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8080/api/webhooks/stripe`

### Raw Body Middleware (`server/index.js`)
- `express.raw({ type: 'application/json' })` mounted on `/api/webhooks/stripe` **above** `express.json()` in the middleware stack
- Required for Stripe signature verification — `constructEvent` needs the raw request body, not parsed JSON

### Checkout Route (`server/routes/checkout.js`)
- `POST /api/checkout/create-session` — protected by `isAuthenticated`
- Validates `courseId`, checks course exists and is published, checks for existing active enrollment
- Lazy Stripe initialization via `getStripe()` factory (same pattern as Resend on WWT)
- Creates Stripe Checkout Session with `price_data` built from course record (price in cents, no pre-created Stripe products needed)
- Attaches `userId` and `courseId` in session `metadata` — round-trips through webhook for enrollment creation
- `success_url` redirects to `/dashboard?purchased={slug}`, `cancel_url` back to course landing page
- Returns `{ url }` for client-side redirect to Stripe hosted checkout

### Webhook Route (`server/routes/webhooks.js`)
- `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` — no auth middleware (Stripe calls this directly)
- Verifies webhook signature with `constructEvent` + `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- On `checkout.session.completed`: reads `userId` and `courseId` from `session.metadata`
- Uses `findOneAndUpdate` with `upsert: true` — idempotent against duplicate webhook deliveries (compound unique index on Enrollment prevents duplicates)
- Enrollment created in webhook handler only — never on frontend redirect (per architecture doc)

### Wiring
- Both routes mounted in `index.js`: `/api/checkout` and `/api/webhooks`
- Full end-to-end test deferred to Phase 5 when browser auth + buy button are available
